<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a web-based SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) monitoring system.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- The application should be based on a Figma design provided by the user.
- The initial theme should be a light, white/blue-based color scheme.
- The frontend should be built first.
- The UI should be professional and aesthetically pleasing, with multiple iterations requested by the user for alignment, color schemes, and component styling.
- **Key Features:**
    1.  **Login & Dashboard Selection:** A login page leading to a dashboard selection screen for different industries.
    2.  **Main Dashboard:** A comprehensive view of SCADA parameters, including:
        -   KPI Summary
        -   Gas Composition
        -   Dew Point Meter
        -   Digesters (1 & 2)
        -   Tank Levels
        -   Water Flow Meters
    3.  **Trends Page:** A page for visualizing historical data trends for all important parameters.
    4.  **Advanced Reports Page:** A page to generate reports, including:
        -   Descriptions of what each report contains.
        -   A custom report builder.
        -   A preview modal for generated reports.
        -   A calendar for custom date range selection.
    5.  **Branding:** The UI must display the owner's logo (LR Energy) on the top-left and a technology partner's logo (ELAN) on the top-right of every page.
    6.  **Footer:** A professional footer with copyright and disclaimer text.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A complete frontend-only React application for the SCADA monitoring system has been developed. The application's data is currently mocked within the components. The UI has undergone several iterations of improvements based on user feedback, resulting in a professional, branded interface.

The application includes:
- A full authentication flow UI (Login page -> Dashboard List page).
- The main SCADA dashboard with all requested monitoring components.
- A redesigned Trends page showing historical data charts.
- An Advanced Reports page with a custom builder, preview modal, and a date picker.
- Consistent dual-logo branding across all pages and a professional footer.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The user was not satisfied with the visual design and logo placement on the Login page, requesting a more creative layout. The agent acknowledged the request and was about to start the redesign.
-   **Status:** NOT STARTED
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** screenshot tool
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Redesign Login Page UI (P0)**
    -   **Description:** The user finds the current logo placement and design on the login page uncreative and has requested a redesign for better visual appeal.
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent successfully added both required logos to the page, but the aesthetic was not approved by the user.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Rethink the layout of .
        2.  Experiment with different placements, sizes, and styles for the two logos to create a more modern and visually engaging login screen.
        3.  Consider adjusting the form's position relative to the logos.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To meet the user's design expectations and improve the first impression of the application.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend

-   **Issue 2: Potential UI alignment issue at 100% zoom (P1)**
    -   **Description:** The user reported an alignment issue on the KPI cards when viewing the page at 100% zoom. The agent could not reproduce it, and the user moved on. This may be a latent bug.
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent took a screenshot at 100% zoom but did not see any issue.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Proactively ask the user if they are still experiencing the alignment issue at 100% zoom.
        2.  If so, request a new, highlighted screenshot.
        3.  Inspect CSS (Flexbox/Grid properties) in  and  for potential zoom-related rendering inconsistencies.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To ensure the UI is robust and visually consistent across different user environments.
    -   **Status:** BLOCKED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** Waiting for user confirmation and a new screenshot.

**In progress Task List**:
None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   **P0: Implement Login Page Redesign:** Redesign  as per the user's feedback for a more creative UI.
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   **P1: Full Backend Implementation:** The application is currently frontend-only. The next major phase is to build the backend.
        -   **Files:** 
        -   **Action:** Create FastAPI endpoints to serve real data for all SCADA components. Define MongoDB schemas and connect the frontend to these endpoints, removing all mocked data.
    -   **P2: Deployment Guidance:** The user has expressed interest in deploying to GoDaddy.
        -   **Action:** Provide guidance on deploying the React frontend as static files and explain the hosting requirements for the FastAPI backend (e.g., a VPS), as it's not supported on standard GoDaddy shared hosting. This request should be handled by the .

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Initial Frontend Implementation:** Created all core components for the SCADA dashboard based on the user's Figma design.
-   **Major UI Redesign (Glass Control Room):** Executed a complete visual overhaul using  guidelines for a more professional look.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS
-   **Backend (Planned):** FastAPI
-   **Database (Planned):** MongoDB
-   **Architecture:** The project is a single-page application (SPA) with a component-based structure. All data is currently mocked in the frontend components.

**key DB schema**
-   N/A (Database not implemented)

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**
-   : Primary file for the current task of redesigning the login UI.
-   : Main application component handling routing and layout.
-   : Directory containing all UI components built and modified during the session.
-   , : Core files for the application's design system and styling.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   **Data Mocking:** All data is hardcoded within individual components. This should be refactored to use a centralized state or custom hooks in preparation for backend integration.
-   **Component Complexity:** The  and its modal components (, ) were refactored to fix build errors but could be reviewed for clarity and maintainability.

**key api endpoints**
-   N/A (Backend not implemented)

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Frontend Only:** The entire application is a UI prototype with mocked data. The next major phase will be backend implementation. Do not assume any backend logic exists.
-   **User is UI-Focused:** The user is highly attentive to visual details like alignment, spacing, and color. Use the  frequently to verify UI changes before presenting them to the user.
-   **Build Tool Sensitivity:** There were recurring  recursion errors when creating complex, nested components for the Reports page. To avoid this, favor splitting complex UI logic into smaller, independent child components.

-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
-   **Test files created:** None
-   **Known regressions:** A complex component structure for  previously caused recurring Babel compilation errors. This was fixed by refactoring into smaller components, but the sensitivity in the build tool may still exist.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   N/A. The login is a UI mock. Any text in the input fields will allow navigation.

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent did not follow up on the user's report of a UI alignment issue at 100% zoom after being unable to reproduce it initially. The user changed the subject, but the potential bug was left unconfirmed.</analysis>
